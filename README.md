# 🌍 AI Translation App for Beginners



Welcome to the AI Translation App! This project is a simple yet powerful translation tool built using pre-trained AI models. It’s designed to be an easy entry point for beginners who want to explore the world of AI and machine learning.



# 🚀 What is This Project?

This app allows you to translate text between English, Spanish, and French using state-of-the-art AI models. It’s built with simplicity in mind, so you can focus on understanding how AI works without getting bogged down by complex code.


# 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used to build the app.
Streamlit: A user-friendly framework for creating web apps with Python.
Hugging Face Transformers: A library that provides easy access to pre-trained AI models.
SentencePiece: A library for text tokenization, which helps the AI understand and process text.
# 📦 Setup Instructions
1. Install Dependencies: Open your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary libraries:
```python
pip install streamlit transformers sentencepiece
```
2. Save the Script: Copy the code from translation_app.py (available in this repository) and save it as translation_app.py on your computer.
3. Run the App: In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the script and run:
```python
streamlit run translation_app.py
```
4. Open Your Browser: The app should automatically open in your web browser. If not, go to http://localhost:8501.
# 🎉 How to Use
1. Enter Text: Type or paste the text you want to translate into the text area.
2. Select Languages: Choose the source language (the language of your text) and the target language (the language you want to translate to).
3. Translate: Click the "Translate" button and wait for the magic to happen!
4. View Translation: The translated text will appear below.
# 🤖 About Pre-trained Models
Pre-trained models are like smart assistants that have already learned a lot from big collections of text. In this project, we use these models to translate text from one language to another without having to teach them everything from scratch.

Specifically, we use the MarianMT models from Hugging Face, which are designed for translation tasks. These models have been trained on vast amounts of multilingual data, making them highly effective at understanding and generating text in different languages.
